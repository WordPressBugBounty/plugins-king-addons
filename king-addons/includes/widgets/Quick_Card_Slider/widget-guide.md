# Simple Card Slider - Widget Guide

## Overview
Simple Card Slider displays manual cards (image, title, description, button) in a responsive slider. Default styling adds spacing so arrows and pagination never overlap the cards.

## Free Features
- Manual cards via repeater (image, title, description, button with link).
- Responsive slides per view, gap, loop, autoplay delay, and speed.
- Show/hide arrows and dots with inside/outside placement, alignment, gap, and offsets.
- Base styling controls for cards, text, buttons, arrows, and dots.

## Pro Features
- Per-card badges/ribbons with styling.
- Advanced entrance/hover animations for cards.
- Additional navigation and pagination style presets and placements.
- Extended offsets, typography, and color controls for badges and chrome.

## How to Use
1. Add “Simple Card Slider” to the page.
2. Populate cards in the Cards section (image, text, and button link).
3. Adjust Slides Per View (desktop/tablet/mobile) and Space Between.
4. Toggle Arrows/Pagination and set their placement (inside/outside) and alignment.
5. Style card background, typography, buttons, arrows, and dots as needed.

## Tips
- Keep at least 16–20px gap when using inside navigation to avoid crowding the card edges.
- Use outside pagination when slides have tall content to preserve vertical space.
- Set consistent image sizes with the Image Size control for tidy layouts.
