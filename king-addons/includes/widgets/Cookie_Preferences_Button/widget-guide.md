# Cookie Preferences Button

Adds a button that opens the King Addons Cookie / Consent Bar settings modal so visitors can review or change their consent.

## Usage
- Drag the **Cookie Preferences Button** widget into your layout.
- Set the label and alignment. Style colors, border, radius, typography, and spacing.
- The button uses the consent UI rendered by the Cookie / Consent Bar extension. Keep that extension enabled.

## Free vs Pro
- **Free:** Label, alignment, core styling.
- **Pro:** Icon support, hover background color, and advanced styling controls. Consent modal unlocks Pro options (region targeting, extra categories, manual blocks, logs, import/export).

## Notes
- The button triggers the same consent modal as the banner. If the banner is dismissed, clicking the button reopens settings.
- Shortcode alternative: `[king_addons_cookie_settings label="Cookie settings"]`.
